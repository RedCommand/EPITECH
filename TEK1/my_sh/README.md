### Overview

This project is a part of the **first** year of Epitech.<br>
I had **2 weeks** to complete it. :spiral_calendar:<br>

The goal of this project was to create a **shell** that support the tcsh syntax in **C**. :desktop_computer:<br>

### Features

* get executable list from `$PATH` variable
* environement variables with `$<variable name>`
* redirect: `<`, `<<`, `<<<`, `>` and `>>`
* pipes `|` and `&&`
* set and unset varable with `set` and `unset` (like tcsh)
* signals redirect
* interupt with `CTRL-C`
* exit with `CTRL-D`
